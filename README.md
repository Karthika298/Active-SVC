# Active-SVM
This project is inspired by the innovative application of ActiveSVM in **“Minimal gene set discovery in single-cell mRNA-seq datasets with ActiveSVM”**. **ActiveSVM** is a feature selection technique that identifies minimal yet highly informative gene sets, enabling efficient classification in single-cell datasets. In this project, we adapt ActiveSVM for chemoinformatic classification tasks. By employing this approach, we aim to streamline the classification tasks, enhancing accuracy and reducing computational requirements. With ActiveSVM in chemoinformatics, we can achieve robust classification results with a minimal number of features, making it a valuable tool for drug discovery and molecular property prediction.

```bash
!pip install activeSVC==4.0.1
!pip install psutil
